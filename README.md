# Machine Learning Model for Stock Prediction

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to deploy a machine learning model capable of predicting stock market prices. This involves training a predictive model, developing a system for real-time deployment, and providing an API endpoint for clients to access stock predictions.

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The primary programming language used
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) - The web framework used for the API
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Used for data manipulation and analysis
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) - Used for machine learning model development



## [Bonus] Monitoring System

Implementing a monitoring system to track the modelâ€™s performance and accuracy over time is an additional feature of this project. Tracking the `MAE`, `Rmse`, `R2` score of the model.
